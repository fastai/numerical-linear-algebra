For instance, many web browsers use a bloom filter to create a set of blocked pages (e.g. pages with viruses), since blocked web pages are only a small fraction of the whole web. A false positive can be handled here by taking anything returned by the bloom filter and checking against a web service with the full exact list.  (See this [bloom filter tutorial](https://llimllib.github.io/bloomfilter-tutorial/) for more details)."

    "Above we covered how *numbers* are stored, now let's talk about how *matrices* are stored. A key way to save memory (and computation) is not to store all of your matrix. Instead, just store the non-zero elements. This is called **sparse** storage, and it is well suited to sparse matrices, that is, matrices where most elements are zero.\n",

    "Using slower ways to access data (e.g. over the internet) can be up to a billion times slower than faster ways (e.g. from a register). But there's much less fast storage than slow storage. So once we have data in fast storage, we want to do any computation required at that time, rather than having to load it multiple times each time we need it. In addition, for most types of storage its much faster to access data items that are stored next to each other, so we should try to always use any data stored nearby that we know we'll need soon. These two issues are known as locality."

    "The issue of \"temporaries\" occurs when the result of a calculation is stored in a temporary variable in RAM, and then that variable is loaded to do another calculation on it. This is many orders of magnitude slower than simply keeping the data in cache or registers and doing all necessary computations before storing the final result in RAM. This is particularly an issue for us since numpy generally creates temporaries for every single operation or function it does. E.g. $a=b\\cdot c^2+ln(d)$ will create four temporaries (since there are four operations and functions)."

    "Often we'll find that we have more data than we have memory to handle, or time to compute. In such a case we would like to be able to scale our algorithm across [multiple cores](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/processor-core-makeuseof-explains-2/) (within one computer) or nodes (i.e. multiple computers on a network). We will not be tackling multi-node scaling in this course, although we will look at scaling across multiple cores (called parallelization). In general, scalable algorithms are those where the input can be broken up into smaller pieces, each of which are handled by a different core/computer, and then are put back together at the end."
