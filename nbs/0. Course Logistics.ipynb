    "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n",

We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game.  Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n",
