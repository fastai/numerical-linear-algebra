**Key Question of this course:** How can we do matrix computations with acceptable speed and accuracy? So, the following are key concepts to keep top of mind:
* Memory use
* Speed
* Accuracy
* Scalability/Parallelization

### Motivation
* Anything that can be put in Excel is a matrix...so you can easily see how matrices are everywhere!
* Fast-moving innovation & new applications proliferate in deep learning, recommendation systems, approximate algorithms, graph analytics, etc.

### Matrix computations
1. Matrix & tensor products (putting them together)
2. Matrix decompositions (taking them apart)
